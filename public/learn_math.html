        Mathematics can be broadly grouped into the following branches:
        
            <li>Arithmetic: It is the oldest and the most elementary among other branches of mathematics. It deals with numbers and the basic operations- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, between them.</li>

            <li> Algebra: It is a kind of arithmetic where we use unknown quantities along with numbers. These unknown quantities are represented by letters of the English alphabet such as X, Y, A, B, etc. or symbols. The use of letters helps us to generalize the formulas and rules and also helps you find the unknown missing values in the algebraic expressions and equations. </li>

            <li> Geometry: It is the most practical branch of mathematics that deals with shapes and sizes of figures and their properties. The basic elements of geometry are points, lines, angles, surfaces and solids.
                There are some other branches of mathematics that you would deal with in the higher classes. </li>

            <li> Trigonometry: Derived from two Greek terms, i.e., trigon (means a triangle) and metron (means measurement), it is the study of relationships between angles and sides of triangles. </li>

            <li>Analysis: It is the branch that deals with the study of the rate of change in different quantities. Calculus forms the base of analysis</li>
